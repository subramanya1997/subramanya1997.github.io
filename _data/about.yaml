#Bio
bio: I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, specializing in Machine Learning. At UMass, I worked with <a href='https://hcr.cs.umass.edu/people/hzhang'>Prof. Hao Zhang</a> at the <a href='https://hcr.cs.umass.edu'>Human-Centered Robotics Lab</a>, focusing on Vision-Language Integration to enable robots to reference arbitrary objects.
research_interest: Currently, I lead cutting-edge initiatives at Dylog, where I architect state-of-the-art conversational AI and search platforms, leveraging my expertise in machine learning. Concurrently, as a Co-Founder of NockOut, I am driving innovation in sports and fitness management through technology.
history: Previously, I served as Head of Product Development at <a href='https://www.renderpub.com'>RenderPub, India</a>, and completed an internship at <a href='https://www.vertica.com'>Vertica</a>, PA. During my undergraduate years at the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore, I co-founded Yourkraft, a platform to streamline musician bookings, and Vayam, a non-profit dedicated to empowering individuals through education and equality.
