As AI agents become more sophisticated and autonomous, a fundamental question is emerging: should agents operate under user credentials, or do they need their own distinct identities? This isn't just a technical curiosity—it's a critical trust and security decision that will shape how we build reliable, accountable AI systems.

The question gained prominence when an engineer asked: "Why can't we just pass the user's OIDC token through to the agent? Why complicate things with separate agent identities?" The answer reveals deeper implications for trust, security, and governance in our AI-driven future.

## When User Identity Works: The Simple Case

For many AI agents today, user identity propagation works perfectly. Consider a Kubernetes troubleshooting agent that helps developers debug failing pods. When a user asks "why is my pod failing?", the agent investigates pod events, logs, and configurations—all within the user's existing RBAC permissions. The agent acts as an intelligent intermediary, but the user remains fully responsible for the actions and outcomes.

This approach succeeds when agents operate as sophisticated tools: they work within the user's session timeframe, perform clearly user-initiated actions, and maintain the user's accountability. The trust model remains simple and familiar—the agent is merely an extension of the user's capabilities.

## The Trust Gap: Where User Identity Falls Short

However, as agents become more autonomous and capable, this simple model breaks down in ways that create significant trust and security challenges.

**The Capability Mismatch Problem**

Imagine a marketing manager asking an AI agent to verify GDPR compliance for a new campaign. The manager has permissions to read and write marketing content, but the compliance agent needs far broader access: scanning marketing data across all departments, accessing audit logs, cross-referencing customer data with privacy regulations, and analyzing historical compliance patterns.

Using the manager's token creates an impossible choice: either the agent fails because it can't access necessary resources, or the manager receives dangerously broad permissions they don't need and shouldn't have. Neither option serves security or operational needs effectively.

**The Attribution Challenge**

More concerning is the accountability problem that emerges with autonomous decision-making. Consider a supply chain optimization agent tasked with "optimizing hardware procurement." The user never explicitly authorized accessing financial records or integrating with vendor APIs, yet the agent determines these actions are necessary to fulfill the optimization request.

When the agent makes an automated purchase order that goes wrong, who bears responsibility? The user who made a high-level request, or the agent that made specific autonomous decisions based on its interpretation of that request? With only user identity, everything gets attributed to the user—creating a dangerous disconnect between authority and accountability.

This attribution gap becomes critical for compliance, audit trails, and risk management. Organizations need to trace not just what happened, but who or what made each decision in the chain: user intent → agent interpretation → agent decision → system action.

## The Path Forward: Embracing Dual Identity

The solution isn't choosing between user and agent identity—it's recognizing that both are necessary. This mirrors lessons from service mesh architectures, where zero trust requires considering both user identity and workload identity.

In this dual model, agents operate within delegated authority from users while maintaining their own identity for the specific decisions they make. The user grants the agent permission to "optimize supply chain," but the agent's identity governs what resources it can access and what actions it can take within that scope.

This approach offers several trust advantages: clearer attribution of decisions, more precise permission boundaries, better audit trails, and the ability to revoke or modify agent capabilities independently of user permissions. Technical implementations might leverage existing frameworks like SPIFFE for workload identity or extend OAuth 2.0 for agent-specific flows.

The dual identity model also enables more sophisticated scenarios, like agent-to-agent delegation, where one agent authorizes another to perform specific tasks—each maintaining its own identity and accountability.

## Building Trustworthy Agent Systems

Getting agent identity right isn't just a technical challenge—it's fundamental to building AI systems that organizations can trust at scale. As agents become more autonomous, we need identity frameworks that provide clear attribution, appropriate authorization, and robust governance.

The community is still working through delegation mechanisms, revocation strategies, and authentication protocols for agent interactions. But one thing is clear—the simple days of "just use the user's token" are behind us. The future of trustworthy AI depends on solving these identity challenges with security and accountability as primary design principles.
